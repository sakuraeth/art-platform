This Solidity smart contract repository is designed to enable the creation and management of NFTs that represent digital art, fully compliant with the ERC-721 standard for non-fungible tokens. The contract features core functionalities including the ability to mint new tokens, transfer ownership, and query details about who owns which token. Moreover, it allows each NFT to carry unique metadata specifying the artist's name, the title of the artwork, and a URL linking to the image file, ensuring that each piece of digital art is distinctly represented on the blockchain. This implementation provides artists and collectors a secure and immutable platform to share and collect digital art, fostering a vibrant ecosystem for the digital art community.
